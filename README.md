# calculate_days - (Using Codeigniter)

*** This calculator calculates the number of days between two dates without using PHP core functions.***

General: 

I have been challanged to create interface for user in PHP to calculate date difference WITHOUT using core functions of PHP. I was given liberty to choose any MVC so I choose (actually I love) codeigniter. 

** CODE directory consist whole codeigniter with my own custom code. 


Development:

I figure it out two ways to do it. Please find two different solution to this problem. I hope this might help you.

Controller:  code\application\controllers\Datediff.php
Model: As I dont need to store anything on database side so I haven't created model.
View: code\application\views\date_diff.php

## Feel free to contact if anything is not clear.
